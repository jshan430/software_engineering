Student #1: 
Homepage:
It is designed with a simple, straightforward homepage.
Also, it clearly answers what can the visitor do here.

I like the ideal of displaying reviews and ratings. It is really useful for any students  
who might take the course next semester.

rate_a_course:
The content on this page is well-organized. It allows the visitor to flow easily.

Student #2:
rate a course:
the layout is easy to follow, the additional instructions next to the text boxes makes it clear what should be inputted. 

Course page and Homepage:
The most relevant information, such as recent reviews, is not the most prominent thing on the page. The white text boxes blend in with the white background therefore most of the attention is on the gray text box on the top.

Overall, perhaps the background color could be change to something other than white to add more contrast between the textboxes and background.
